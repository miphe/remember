## Acceptance tests

### Notification when new entry/note has been created
- Whenever I and/or other user (that within my own group) create an entry/notes, I see a browser notification pops-up and telling there's a new entry.
- In the browser notification pop-up I see:
  - the name of the author
  - title of the entry
  - category of the entry
  - and excerpt of the entry
- When I click the browser notification popups-up and I click it, it brings me to that other user's entry directly.

### Notification when new comments has been created
- Whenever I and/or other user(s) make a comments to my entry/notes or some user's notes (that within my own group), I see a browser notification pops-up and telling me about that.
- In the browser notification pop-up I see:
  - title of the entry
  - category of the entry
  - the name of the user who make the comments
  - and excerpt of the comments
- When I click the browser notification popups-up and I click it, it brings me to that other user's comments directly.
