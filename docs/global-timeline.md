# Global timeline
There's a centralized place/page (widget) where I'm able to see some list of activity to show what I had been doing, and what other user had been doing, in real time.

## Acceptance Test
- I see a list of notes/entry that I've been creating.
- I see a list of users who make the comments of my notes/entry.
- I see a list of users who make the comments to some user's notes/entry.
- I click one of activity of notes from the timeline, it brings directly to that particular notes/entry.
- I click one of activity of comments from the timeline, it brings directly to that comments in respective notes/entry.
