# Link to entry

Linking to an entry through regular markdown hyperlinks.

## Acceptance tests

- I can link to an entry by writing a regular markdown hyperlink like `[my link text](http://domain.com/entry/gYgsf5R)`.
- Clicking that link takes me to the correct entry.
- I can write a relative link like this: `[my link text](entry/gYgsf5R)`.
- I can copy to URL in the address field to save the link target (the URL represents the entry).
