# Search results

When being presented the results of my search, some requirements needs to be met.

## Acceptance tests

- I can see an excerpt of the entry. In this excerpt the search term I used to find it, should be highlighted (or bolded).
- I can see the date and time when the entries were created.
- I can see who was the original author of the entry
- I can see the title of the entry
- The dates for each entry are aligned properly so that I can scan through the results easily to find a certain date.
- There is an easily accessible link for each entry result which I can click to [see that entry in full view](view-entry.md).
- There is an easily accessible link for each entry result which I can click to [resume that entry](continue-entry.md).
